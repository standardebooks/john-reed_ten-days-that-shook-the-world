				</hgroup>
				<p>I myself verified the damage to the Kremlin, which I visited immediately after the bombardment. The Little Nicolai Palace, a building of no particular importance, which was occupied occasionally by receptions of one of the Grand Duchesses, had served as barracks for the <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">yunkers.</i> It was not only bombarded, but pretty well sacked; fortunately there was nothing in it of particular historical value.</p>
				<p>Usspensky Cathedral had a shell-hole in one of the cupolas, but except for a few feet of mosaic in the ceiling, was undamaged. The frescoes on the porch of Blagovestchensky Cathedral were badly damaged by a shell. Another shell hit the corner of Ivan Veliki. Tchudovsky Monastery was hit about thirty times, but only one shell went through a window into the interior, the others breaking the brick window-moulding and the roof cornices.</p>
				<p>The clock over the Spasskaya Gate was smashed. Troitsky Gate was battered, but easily reparable. One of the lower towers had lost its brick spire.</p>
				<p>The church of <abbr>St.</abbr> Basil was untouched, as was the great Imperial Palace, with all the treasures of Moscow and Petrograd in its cellar, and the crown jewels in the Treasury. These places were not even entered.</p>

				<p>“Comrades! You are the young masters of the country, and although now you have much to do and think about, you must know how to defend your artistic and scientific treasures.</p>
				<p>“Comrades! That which is happening at Moscow is a horrible, irreparable misfortune.⁠ ⁠… The People in its struggle for the power has mutilated our glorious capital.</p>
				<p>“It is particularly terrible in these days of violent struggle, of destructive warfare, to be Commissar of Public Education. Only the hope of the victory of Socialism, the source of a new and superior culture, brings me comfort. On me weighs the responsibility of protecting the artistic wealth of the people.⁠ ⁠… Not being able to remain at my post, where I had no influence, I resigned. My comrades, the other Commissars, considered this resignation inadmissible. I shall therefore remain at my post.⁠ ⁠… And moreover, I understand that the damage done to the Kremlin is not as serious as has been reported.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>“But I beg you, comrades, to give me your support.⁠ ⁠… Preserve for yourselves and your descendants the beauty of our land; be the guardians of the property of the People.</p>
				<p>“Soon, very soon, even the most ignorant, who have been held in ignorance so long, will awake and understand what a source of joy, strength and wisdom is art.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
